# The sources section points out both files and folders that
# needs to be backed up. Wildcard is not allowed, tool will
# always recurse into directories.
#
[sources]

# Some extra paths needed by the tool.
# "prep dir" is used for temporary storage (creating archive, signing etc)
# "data dir" is used for storing information needed to track changes
# "done dir" is used for storing successfully backed up archives. Each backup is
#            stored in its own folder. Note! It copies and then deletes,
#            so needs extra space. Leave blank to disable.
#
[paths]
prep dir: backup/inprogress/
data dir: backup/metadata/
done dir: backup/done/

# Allows tweaking the tool
# "max size" sets an upper limit of the archive's uncompressed size. Note! If
#            parity is enabled, max size is automaticallt restricted to 32GB or
#            less due to limitations in PAR2
#
#            NOTE! Due to the stage-by-stage nature of this tool, you should be
#                  aware that it will at times consume twice the space for temporary
#                  files. So while max size defines the max size of the content
#                  grabbed, it does not limit the end-result (which can vary, see
#                  security section) nor does it take temp files into account.
#
# "change method" determines how changes are detected. "data" uses sha1 of
#                 the data. You can also specify sha1, sha256 or sha512 explicityly
#                 depending on your needs. For most users, data (sha1) is enough
#                 and will also have the benefit of being fairly quick.
#
#                 "meta" is deprecated and will error out.
#
# "delta manifest" yes/no
#
#   Allows you to store a copy of the files contained within the backup. This helps
#   you locate that elusive file when in a pinch. The default for this option is "yes",
#   if you prefer not to keep a manifest, then "no" will disable it.
#
# "compress" yes/no/force
#
#   Normally yes, no disables and force ignores internal rules.
#   Uses bzip2 compression.
#
# "persuasive" Normally no, but if yes, will try and fit as many files into the
#              maxsize restriction, leaving some for another day. This results
#              in a more uniform sized uploads, no data will ever be lost, it
#              just will come at a later session. TODO
#
# "ignore overlimit" will cause iceshelf to return 0 even if files were skipped.
#                    However, if there are more files which WOULD fit, it will work
#                    as expected (ie, tell you to run it again).
#
# "incompressible" allows you to add additional extensions for files which won't
#                  compress very well. To add more than one, separate them using space.
# "max keep" allows you to automatically keep a max of X backups in the done folder.
#            If done folder is undefined, this option has no effect. If the folder exists
#            but this option is blank or zero, there is no limit (unlimited)
#
# "prefix" is optional, but when available defines a prefix to be added to all
#          generated backup files (so you can store more than one backup in the same vault)
#
# "detect move" if true, a moved file will only result in the actual operation being
#               backed up. This saves on data. ***EXPERIMENTAL SEE README.MD***
#
# "skip empty" if true, skips the backup if no changes are detected
#
# Example:
#   "File_A" was renamed to "File_B" will cause the manifest to just log the move
#
# If the option is disabled, "File_B" will be backed up and "File_A" will be marked as
# deleted

# Exclusion rules
# All rules are processed in the order they are defined, as soon as a rule
# matches, it will stop processing the rest.
#
# Rules are defined by <name>=<rule> where name can be whatever you want.
# rule without any special prefix is simply a textual match of the complete
# filename including the path. However, this can be extended by the following
# prefixes:
#
# *<rule>   Matches from the end of the filename instead of start
# ?<rule>   Matches any part of the filename
# ><rule>   Tests the filesize, if bigger than <rule>, then it's excluded
# <<rule>   Tests the filesize, if less than <rule>, the it's excluded
#
# |<file>   Load a list of exclusions from <file> ... The format of the file
#           is such that it omits the "<name>=" part of the syntax. Just the
#           rules straight up with potential modifiers.
#           With ONE exception, a loaded file cannot use the | prefix in the
#           rules. This is to avoid unexpected relationships.
#           Also consider that the order of the rules STILL apply, even when
#           loading external files.
#
# There is also a special modifier which you can prefix the entire rule with.
# By adding an exclamationmark, you invert the rule. Now if it matches the
# content WILL be included. That allows for some snazzy rules such as:
#
#  [exclude]
#  alldocs=!*.doc
#  no odd dirs=/some/odd/dir/
#
# In a structure like this:
#  /some/
#  /some/data.txt
#  /some/todo.doc
#  /some/odd/dir/
#  /some/odd/dir/moredata.txt
#  /some/odd/dir/readme.doc
#
# It will backup the following:
#  /some/data.txt
#  /some/todo.doc
#  /some/odd/dir/readme.doc
#
# Notice how it snagged a file from inside an excluded folder? Pretty
# convenient. However, in order for this to work, you must consider the
# order of the rules. If you change the order to:
#
#  [exclude]
#  no odd dirs=/some/odd/dir/
#  alldocs=!*.doc
#
# The "no odd dirs" would trigger first and the second rule would never get a
# chance to be evaluated. If you're having issues with the rules, consider
# running iceshelf with --changes and --debug to see what it's doing.

# Iceshelf uses aws commandline tool for uploading the backups, so please make sure

#
# "vault" points out a nice vault to place the backups in. If the vault is
#         missing, it will be created automatically.
# "threads" Number of threads to use when uploading, each thread responsible for
#           a chunk of the file. This can greatly speed up uploads.

# Run custom command before and/or after backup
#
# "pre command" is run before anything is done

# The post command will be provided with the complete path and filename of the created files

#
# If any of these commands return non-zero, it will cause the backup to abort.

# Using post command, you can easily adapt iceshelf to upload the result to another storage
